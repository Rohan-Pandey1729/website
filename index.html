        <p> I'm a Research Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer. I'm currently a Project Manager Intern at NASA for the LUCY L'SPACE Mission.</p>
        <p>I study Applied and Computational Mathematical Sciences with a concentration in Scientific Computing and Numerical Analysis at University of Washington. I also am minoring in Neural Computation and Engineering with an interest to have an application of AI in Neuroscience.</p>

        <p>Previously, I was the Lead Embedded Systems Engineer at the Society of Advanced Rocket Propulsion (SARP) club at UW. I worked on building the Autonomous Recovery Electronics System for our rocket (which was successful at our participation at Spaceport America Cup).</p>

        <p>In my off time, I play competitive tennis at UW and I enjoy playing many board games, although Monopoly has to be my favorite (probably because I haven't lost in a few years).</p>
        <p>I love to meet new people, so please shoot me an email if you want to talk! Or play a game of Monopoly.</p>
